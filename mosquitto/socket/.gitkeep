A local mosquitto server using `mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf` will create a `mosquitto.sock` socket in this directory.

If using the `docker-compose.yml` container environment, a shared container volume will be mounted here.

This allows tests that connect to mosquitto via unix domain socket to assume the socket(s) will be found in this directory and work from multiple environments.

Do not remove this directory.
